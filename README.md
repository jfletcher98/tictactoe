#tic tac toe

Player1: John Fletcher, Player 2: Giles Wootton

This is a very simple tic tac toe game that will always alternate between two players until a total of 9 turns have completed.
There is no win logic, meaning the game finishes when 9 turns in total have finished. Also, you are able to place a marker on
an already marked spot, so play fair!

To run it, you will just compile and execute like any other cpp file.
